# MVW Navigation
This small module can be used to create an HTML navigation from a given JSON file
containing the structure of the site. It also supports the generation of
multiple independant navigations, like e.g. a left navigation, a main navigation
and a footer navigation.

The output can either be plain HTML or pug.
